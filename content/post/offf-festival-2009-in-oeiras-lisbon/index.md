OFFF Festival is back in Lisbon and will take place during three days, from the 7th of May. This year's moto is a very interesting one: "Fail Gracefully". It's an interesting subject, particularly for electronic performance arts, so unstable and willing to fail in the most crucial moment. There's nothing worst than an onstage computer chime. Also if you develop tangible interfaces you'll be mapping your natural environment through sensor acquisition, which naturally glitches. But we've learned to encompass these failures in our area and OFFF proposes that we embrace it, learn from it and even laugh at it. Error is also natural to the digital world.

I'll be talking and maybe performing so make sure you drop by and pay us a visit at [OFFF](http://www.offf.ws/ "OFFF 2009") in Oeiras.
