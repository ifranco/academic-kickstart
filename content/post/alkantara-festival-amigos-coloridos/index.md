Alkantara is one of the reference Portuguese festivals in performance arts, happening in both Lisbon and Porto.

I'll be showing a new performance with [Lígia](http://www.ligiateixeira.com/) on the 24th of May, in Teatro S. Luís (Lisbon), on "Amigos Coloridos". It's kind of a surprise show, with intensive blind dates between performers and the audience.

"[Amigos Coloridos@Alkantara](http://www.alkantarafestival.pt/festival/index.php?page=espectaculo_detalhe&esp=amigos&id=id_espectaculo "Amigos Coloridos")"

The whole festival will go on until the 9th of June, so be sure to check the rest of the program.
