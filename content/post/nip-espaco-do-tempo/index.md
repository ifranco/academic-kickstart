The last week was spent in [Espaço do Tempo](http://www.oespacodotempo.pt/en/ "Espaço do Tempo"), in residence with the [N.I.P](http://newinterfaces.net/nip/ "New Interfaces for Performance"). group. Espaço do Tempo is located in Montemor-o-Novo, in Portugal. This place is the most amazing and inspiring location for a residence. The contact with nature, the great landscapes and the magical place that is Convento da Saudação... We have to thank [Rui Horta](http://www.oespacodotempo.pt/en/esp_tem.php?idpan=rui_bio "Rui Horta") and his team for their warm welcome.
