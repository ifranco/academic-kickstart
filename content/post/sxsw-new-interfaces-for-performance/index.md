[South by Southwest](http://www.sxsw.com/ "SXSW") is a media festival in Austin/Texas and its better known as an international showcase of new talents in the music industry. SXSW as grown in the last 20 years and now also includes many other activities, such as discussion panels or screenings, and has come to encompass other disciplines of culture and media like "Film" or "Interactive".

Late last year I  proposed to do a panel and the news is I got picked!

So, on March the 17th I'll be discussing with an audience about on "New Interfaces for Performance".

"Realtime computation allowed new media artists to develop interactive performances but typical computer interfaces don’t offer appropriate interaction models for these contexts. In the DIY generation artists learned new techniques to build their own instruments.

Novel interfaces have surfaced and this presentation is a reflection on New Interfaces for Performance."

I'll be joined by Prof. [Bruce Pennycook](http://pennycook.music.utexas.edu/ "Bruce Pennycook") from UTAustin for happy chatting on the subject.

So see you in Austin! :-)
