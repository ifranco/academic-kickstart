I'm traveling on the second week of March, with the N.I.P. crew, to go and play at the Pixelache festival in Helsinki. If you don't know about [Pixelache](http://www.pixelache.ac/), it's a festival with seminars, performances and workshops on the topics of Digital Media. But no one better to explain it than [Juha Huuskonen](http://juhuu.nu/) in this [recent interview](http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/2008/01/transcript-of-the-medellin-con.php "Juha Huuskonen on We Make Money Not Art") on We Make Money Not Art. I'll bring along the Airsticks and get together with André Gonçalves (PT), Tom Verbruggen (NL), Teresa Dillon (UK), Kathy Hinde (UK) and Rudolfo Quintas (PT).
