TED is now a reference conference of Technology, Entertainment and Design. The TEDx initiative is a way of empowering other TEDs to happen outside California. There are many TEDx worldwide and Portugal is no exception. The next event is happening in Aveiro, on the 29th of May.

I'll be speaking about New Electronic Music and Performance, instrument building and the relationship between electronic musicians and the DIY culture. I'll also play the Airstick as a live demo of my own instruments.
