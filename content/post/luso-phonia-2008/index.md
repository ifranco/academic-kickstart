Tonight I'll be playing in Barcelona, at Espai NIU. This event is part of the Luso-phonia Exhibition, an event that wishes to address the relationships between sound art and the social space. It's also a showcase of Portuguese sound artists and electronic musicians in Barcelona. You can check the details at:
