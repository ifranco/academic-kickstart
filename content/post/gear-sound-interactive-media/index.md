Labcom and the Beira Interior University (UBI) are organizing the [GEAR](http://www.gear-up.info/ "GEAR") event from the 7th to the 12th of April. It's a series of talks, demos and concerts on interactive media and it's relation to the academic research. I'll be doing talks on both my artistic practice and also the work at YDreams. I'll be perfoming live on the 8th at Companhia Club (you can check the schedule [here](http://www.gear-up.info/schedule.html "Gear Schedule")).
