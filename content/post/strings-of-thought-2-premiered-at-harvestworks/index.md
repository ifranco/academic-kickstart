A woman sits on a chair and from her head several strings emerge to form a network structure like dendritic trees of neurons. These cells generate electric signals based on potential voltage and the reaction to outside stimuli. Strings of Thought 2 is an interactive installation that invites the audience to explore and play with a musical meta-instrument and collaboratively create an intricate soundscape.

Strings of Thought 2 was premiered at [Harvestworks](http://www.harvestworks.org/ "Harvestworks")(NY) on May 2013.
