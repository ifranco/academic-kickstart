The [Um Festival](http://www.1um1.net "Um Festival") will start next Thursday in Lisbon. It's the first edition of an Experimental and Mixed Media Festival and it will have a very distinct palette of artists, with conferences, workshops and performances. My talk is on Panel 1: "Gesture and Movement Based Interfaces". I'll try to review some electronic music controllers, relationships with the DIY generation and reflect on some design issues.

I'll also perform with the N.I.P. group, where we'll show some results of collaborative experiments of our last residence. Details -> [here](http://www.1um1.net/?p=267).
