This year I submitted a panel to the South by Southwest 2009 Festival, in Austin Texas. This panel addresses the state-of-the-art on New Interfaces for Performance and its future challenges. Since these panels are chosen by the audience I encourage you to vote for my panel atÂ [http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ "SXSW Panel Picker"), under "New Technology, Next Generation". Deadline: 29th of August.
