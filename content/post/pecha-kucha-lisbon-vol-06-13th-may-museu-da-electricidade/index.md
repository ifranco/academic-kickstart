Pecha Kucha is a very interesting approach to sharing ideas and knowledge.

from Wikipedia:

**"Pecha Kucha** (ペチャクチャ), usually pronounced in three syllables like "pe-chak-cha") is a presentation format in which content can be easily, efficiently and informally shown, usually at a public event designed for that purpose. Under the format, a presenter shows 20 images for 20 seconds apiece, for a total time of 6 minutes, 40 seconds.

It was devised in [2003](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003 "2003") by Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham of [Tokyo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo")'s Klein-Dytham Architecture (KDa), who sought to give young designers a venue to meet, network, and show their work and to attract people to their experimental event space in [Roppongi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roppongi "Roppongi").[\[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha#cite_note-metropolis-0) They devised a format that kept presentations very concise in order to encourage audience attention and increase the number of presenters within the course of one night. They took the name Pecha Kucha from a [Japanese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language") term for the sound of conversation ("chit-chat")."

In the meantime Pecha Kucha grew into an international network, happening in around 196 cities by now. Lisbon is not behind and thanks to the work of Pedro Ferreira, Pedro Louro, Pedro Melo and Rita João, we now have the chance to exchange ideas on this new platform.

I'll be talking about a rather different subject, also because of my work at [YDreams](http://www.ydreams.com/ "YDreams"). It seemed like an opportunity to discuss important issues regarding interaction design and it's potential consequences.
