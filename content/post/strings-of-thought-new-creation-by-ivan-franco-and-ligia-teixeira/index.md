title: "Strings of Thought - new creation by Ivan Franco and Lígia Teixeira"

During the last year I've been creating a new dance piece with Lígia Teixeira. Strings of Thought is being developed to be premiered at Guimarães 2012 - European Capital of Culture, and will be performed from the 11-13th July. 

This piece is evocative of the confrontation between our desires and the reality of who we are.  
It is materialized through a fantastic setup of cable suspensions, which interactively create sound and light for the dance piece.

We've been having the help of several key people who deserve mention and who have more than once shown their fantastic support and dedication: Prof. Caetano Monteiro from the Minho University, Liza Wade Green, David Palma and Danny Green, amongst many others. Thanks you!
