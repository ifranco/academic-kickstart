Next Friday will be playing on the [Future Places Festival](http://www.futureplaces.org/ "Future Places"). This event is organized by [Colab](http://www.utaustinportugal.org/ "Colab"), which was created to promote collaboration in the area of emerging technologies between Portuguese Universities and Austin Texas University.

Curated by Heitor Alvelos and Karen Gustafson, FUTURE PLACES is a meeting of people with one question in mind: if digital media can do so much for global communication, knowledge and creativity, how can it contribute to local cultural development? October 2008 marks the start of this challenge. The first edition of FUTURE PLACES will survey current successful projects from very diverse backgrounds and fields of knowledge, and it takes place in Porto, Portugal, where these challenges and this potential are very evident. Join us for thirteen days of exhibitions, films, performances, concerts, lectures, parties and workshops - and bring your ideas and your stories!
