In 2007 YDreams created an [augmented reality]({{< ref "../augmented-reality/index.md" >}})
 ad for the Dove soap brand that allowed moviegoers to play with bubbles on the big screen.

Dove's ad attracted the interest of several investors and partners, so we created Audience Entertainment, a spinoff dedicated to large-scale multi-user interaction with screens.

Audience Entertainment went on to work on several high-profile projects, such as the Orange Festival of Lights in , where 20,000 people collaboratively played a game on a giant screen.

Audience Entertainment also won the 2014 Event Technology Award for their tech demo at SXSW 2014.
