In the late 2000s YDreams's began a research division dedicated to printed electronics and electrochromic displays, later raising significant investment to spin-off as [Ynvisible](https://www.ynvisible.com/). At the time we were mainly looking at inkjet solutions but since then Ynvisible has mastered industrialized manufacturing through roll-to-roll processes.

Ynvisible holds several patents and is traded on TSX Venture Exchange (Canada), OTCQB Venture Market (US) and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Germany).
