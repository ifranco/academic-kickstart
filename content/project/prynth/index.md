Prynth are programmable sound synthesizers powered by single-board computers. They combine the advantages of dedicated hardware with the flexibility of programming.

This project's goal is to develop a set of free technologies and guides for instrument assembly, while fostering knowledge exchange and discussion between creators.

For more information visit the [official Prynth site](https://prynth.github.io/) and the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/prynth/).

Prynth is a significant part of my research at the [Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL)](http://www-new.idmil.org/) / [CIRMMT](http://www.cirmmt.org/) / McGill University, under the supervision of Marcelo M. Wanderley and sponsored by the [Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT)](https://www.fct.pt/).

### Collaborators
