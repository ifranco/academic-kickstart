In 2007/2008 YDreams developed I-Garment, a smart garment for firefighters, equipped with GPS, vital signal monitoring, sensing of body position and alerts. The garment collects all this data in realtime and relays the information to an operational field vehicle via radio-frequency transmission.

With this system, the Civil Protection units can more accurately and effectively manage human resources in the field, assuring individual monitoring of every single firefighter's position and health, even in harsh environments where cellphone infrastructures often fail.

Contractor: YDreams

Client: European Space Agency (ESA).
