In the mid 2000s, one of the most important business activities for YDreams was the creation of digital experiences for retail and brands. Many brick and mortars saw the value in developing more attractive shopping experiences, considering the rise of online sales giants like Amazon. Many brands also understood the need to appeal to a new generation of consumers, which could be accomplish through the showcase of innovation in showrooms and fair booths. YDreams now counts thousands of these projects for clients such as Nike, Disney, Coca-cola or Microsoft.
