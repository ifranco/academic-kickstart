The Vibropixels are self-contained haptic devices, composed of two vibrotactile actuators, four RGB LEDs and a battery. They can be used to create haptic feedback systems for wearables or other interactive devices. The Vibropixels can be controlled individually or by the hundreds, which makes them useful for interactive works with many users or the creation of high-density tactile displays.

The Vibropixels were used in Haptic Fields by Chris Salter and Tez.
