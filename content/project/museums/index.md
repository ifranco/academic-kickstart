In 2002 YDreams created several interactive installations for the "Engenho e Obra" science exhibition, displayed at the Cordoaria Nacional building in Lisbon. At the time this was probably the most technologically advanced exhibition ever done in Portugal. We debuted many of the novel physical interaction principles that would later be used in many YDreams products and services. The "Engenho e Obra" exhibition won the 2012 [Dibner award for Excellence in Museum Exhibits](https://www.historyoftechnology.org/about-us/awards-prizes-and-grants/the-dibner-award/).

Since then YDreams designed many interactive exhibits for museums, including full interior design and implementation. Here are some examples:
